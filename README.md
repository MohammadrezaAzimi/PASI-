# PASI-

### Project description:
Input: Data points which are comprised of 13 features such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), the result of positivity/negativity of skin test on the Head & Neck, Trunk,	Upper,	Lower or	palmoplantar areas, and age of onset (the age that the patient is diagnosed). The dataset is comprised of 190 data points.  30% of data set is used for test data.  

Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI): Depending on the computed index, it is divided into four categories as mild (index < 5), moderate (5 < index < 12), severe (12 < index < 20), very severe (20 < index < 72).  

Goal:  To predict PASI for a new data point.

Approach: A decision tree classifier with maximum depth of 5 is used to classify data points in the training set based on their features. 

The score of trained classifier is 0.79 percent meaning that the average accuracy of model is 0.79.
